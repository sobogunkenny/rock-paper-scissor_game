For the purpose of working on class projects as name above.
This Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules.
If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats;
Rock beats Scissors,
Paper beats Rock,
Scissors beats Paper.
